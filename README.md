Kevin Ventura, Employee Skill Tracking, 2021.MAR

ERD, database build and test scripts

- The intent of the project is to build and employee skills database, the Java code and a Vue from end.
- Found some decent online schema software (app.diagrams.net), designed the db, then built it.
- The db code and the query test code was hand written, not autogenerated. Source files included.


Current Status

- "Home", "List All Employees", "Employee By Id" and "Add Employee" are all wired and function.


Issues

- Vue page formatting, across all pages, is rather simplistic and is not yet responsive.
- View Employee Data link is connected to the employee id and should carry that to the Employee Detail 
  By Id page and display the data. It does not carry that data, though the search does function properly.
- Delete Employee does not yet function in Vue. The Java code has been written.
- Still require an Update Employee header and Vue functionality. The Java code has been written.
- Add an ERD image to the Home page
- Still have not begun to work with the Employee Skills yet. Again, the Java code has been written.
